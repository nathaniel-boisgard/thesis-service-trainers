# Wit.ai Training Script
Use API to batch upload training data

- replace *TOKEN* in `train.sh`
- set *LANG* to fitting language (the one the wit.ai app is set up for)
- put training files in `./data` folder (German in `./data/de`, English in `./data/en`)
- execute `train.sh`:
	- `$ bash ./train.sh`
